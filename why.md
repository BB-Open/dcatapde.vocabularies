# Why this repository

We are developing software for DCAT-AP.de. We noticed that the knowledge about the controlled vocabularies for dcat-AP.de is spread over several documents.

Also the information is sparse and not complete. http://dcat-ap.de hostes some vocabularies but not for all entities. Also we like to focus on [technical aspects](./technical.md) of dcat-ap.de.

While discussing with GOVdata we agreed that BBopen as a prototype should try new ways to deal with controlled vocabularies for DCAT-ap.de.

Our emphasis is to create an open source plattform for dkat-ap.de. This envolves not only the software but also the data/concepts for a sucessfull implementation of dacpt-ap.de.
