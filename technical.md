This repository deals with controlled vocablaries for DCAT-AP.de.

The dcat-ap.de definition site http://dcat-ap.de/def holds some controlled vocabularies. These vocabularies are described as OWL-files.
OWL-Files are well suited to define ontologies aka sematic web class definitions.

> In computer science and information science, an ontology is a formal naming and definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities that really exist in a particular domain of discourse.

We thinkt that SKOS is the correct way to describe controlled vacabularies, also the EU does. All EU vocabularies are described as SKOS.
