Controlled vocabulary can be found on [dcat-ap.de](http://www.dcat-ap.de/def/licenses/)

OWL File [http://www.dcat-ap.de/def/licenses/1_0.rdf](http://www.dcat-ap.de/def/licenses/1_0.rdf)

Our commentary:

OWL is for the definition of classes and not for the specification of controlled vocabularies aka concepts. Since all licenses have the same structure there is no need to define a class for each license.
